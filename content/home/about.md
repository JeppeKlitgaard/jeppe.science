This, my dear Watson, is somewhere between the ramblings of a madman and
subliminal ingeniousness (_probably closer to the former..._).

## A somewhat quick introduction

Now, normally great thinkers of the world would be introduced to their audiences
using a flurry of flattering compliments and extravagant praise.
As I have yet to join such esteemed company, I will have to introduce myself - perhaps with rather less pomp ‚ú®.

My interests are frustratingly broad,
ranging from the ["harder"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_and_soft_science) parts of natural science (_duh_) and computer science and all the way across to the squishy and cuddly social sciences with a particular emphesis on political and societal issues - _could I perhaps interest you in a discussion about the merits of social-liberalism?_ ü§ì

Outside of academia I am a keen woodworker, amateur electrician and overall entirely incompetent DIY'er. üî®üí°

If I were any good at my interests, I would be a [_polymath_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath).
I would never assume such a lofty title, and as dictated by the [cultural norms of Scandinavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Jante),
I take genuine pride in identifying as more of a _polymoron_.

In a similar vein, I also happen to suffer from a mild allergy towards formality,
which the [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/formality) defines as:

> Something that has to be done but has __no real importance__

I believe this may be caused by a deep-rooted trauma sustained during my formative years
in Socialist Paradise[^1] (_Scandinavia_).

For what has now become a majority of my life, I have partaken in recreational programming and I am
a keen Pythonista with strong opinions on code formatting, type hinting and good code hygiene. üêç

    _I try to intersperse them into the text for the reader's and my own benefit.
    Those following along will also know that [__social-liberalism__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_liberalism) is my poison of choice._
