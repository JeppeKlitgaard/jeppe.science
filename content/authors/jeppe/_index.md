I am Jeppe and it appears that you've stumbled upon my website 🌐!

I am an undergraduate physics student at Cambridge,
having uprooted from the comfortable life of rural Denmark
and moved across the North Sea to Cambridge 📍.

Prior to starting my studies I taught for ≈ 2 years in the Danish public school system, a large portion of which was with [ASD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum) students 👨‍🏫.
