As an undergraduate physics student, I am not quite ready for a proper career
yet, but if you have something interesting (and preferably paid 😉) you think
I should be doing with my breaks/holidays, feel free to get in touch!

I am also more than happy to relocate, perhaps getting an opportunity to see
a bit more of the planet we call home 🌍.

I've been involved in quite a few things over the years - I encourage you to have
a 👀 at my CV if you want to learn more.
