I have taken up the habit of keeping a bit of fictional reading in my rucksack
at all times and when the monotony of studying or triviality of transportation
bleakens my outlook, they provide a pleasant existential escape.

Below is an index of my thoughts on some of the books I have read, which I
try to collect entirely for my own benefit and amusement while they're still
lucid.

Notes still to be written:
- Slaughterhouse-Five
- Norwegian Wood
- The Inimitable Jeeves
- Collected Grooks I/II
- Animal Farm
- A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
- The Art of Rest: How to Find Respite in the Modern Age
- The Hunger Games
- A Clockwork Orange
