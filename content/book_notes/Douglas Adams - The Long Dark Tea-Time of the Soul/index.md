## Introduction

Having consumed the first book in the series,
{{< book_note "Douglas Adams - Dirk Gentley's Holistic Detective Agency" >}},
with some enthusiasm, I threw myself at the second book.
One of the charms to me of the the inaugural book of the series was the many
witty references to Cambridge culture, which aren't present this time around
where the story is primarily set in London.

The novelty of Cambridge life has been replaced by another set of cultural
references that I hold near and dear: Norse mythology, which presents itself
through Thor and Odin, the former of which causes quite a ruckus here in
Midgård by virtue of his short fuse and somewhat dim wit.

## Intertextuality

The opening lines of the book is the somewhat iconic quote:

> It can hardly be a coincidence that no language on Earth has ever produced
> the expression 'as pretty as an airport'

This is now, ironically, one of the most quotable passages from Douglas Adams'
bibliography, as would have undoubtedly occurred to him as he wrote it.

Another phrase that is littered across many of the books pages is Dirk's company
motto, which is centered around _holistic_ detective practices and taking seemingly
orthogonal paths of investigation due to the principal _interconnectedness of all things_.

## Recommendation

I found _The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul_ to be just as well-written as the
first book and took great pleasure in getting more familiar with the chaotic
existential philosophy of Dirk Gentley. It's one of the books that I look forward
to rereading at a later point in life.
