## Introduction
I wanted to try some of George Orwell's essays after having read a few
essays by Douglas Adams in {{< book_note "Douglas Adams - The Salmon of Doubt">}},
and found the experience over-all enjoyable, but couldn't really follow along
in some of the essays focused on literary criticism of other great authors.

## In Defence of P. G. Wodehouse
Since learning that Wodehouse was one of Douglas Adams favourite authors,
I had wanted to road some of Wodehouse's work. I was pleasantly surprised to see
that Orwell also found Wodehouse sufficiently noteworthy to dedicate one of his
essays to a discussion of Wodehouse's behaviour during the Second World War.

The essay titled _In Defence of P. G. Wodehouse_ turned out to be my favourite
of the collection totalling 8 essays.

## Shooting an Elephant
Another essay I found to be a particularly interesting read,
perhaps because it unlike the other essays did not necessitate a rather intimate
knowledge of the contemporary literature which I simply do not possess.

It gives a remarkable insight into life under British rule in India through
the eyes of Orwell's youth. Additionally, this essay can easily be brought into
a modern context where British imperialism and exceptionalism continues to
be a topic of some relevance.

## Other Essays
The other essays largely fall into the category of literary criticism, which
were decently interesting to read, but simultaneously far beyond my comprehension
– something that ought to be interesting in and of itself!

## Conclusion
The collection should probably be avoided by anyone who doesn't have a natural
interest in the nitty gritty details of literary debate.
