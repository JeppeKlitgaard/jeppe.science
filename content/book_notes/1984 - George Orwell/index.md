## Introduction

This review is admittedly not written with the titular book completely present in my mind,
as this post serves as my first attempt at writing any book review what-so-ever and
I decided to go for a classic that I've read twice, although both times being frightfully
far back in time at this stage.

## Intertextuality

Items of particular intertextual value include:

- The glass paperweight, 
    which may be understood to symbolise a time prior to dystopian rule and the fragility of democracy
- Big Brother

_To be continued..._.
