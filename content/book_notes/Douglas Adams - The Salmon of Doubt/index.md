## Introduction
This book is the final book in the _Dirk Gentley_ triology for a profoundly
sad reason: Douglas Adams' sudden death in 2001 at the tragically young age of 49.

_The Salmon of Doubt_ was published post-humously based on drafts found on his
beloved Macintosh computer.

## Douglas' Life
The majority of the book falls outside the genre of fiction with the first
section of the book containing descriptions of Douglas Adams personal life and
character by his friends. While well-written and interesting, I am not
much of a biography reader and found myself chugging through the first section
primarily because it seemed like the right thing to do – I find that most books
have their pages arranged in such an order that starting at the beginning and
swiftly making way towards the end is the preferred method of attack.

## Essays
The bulk of the book is made up of a selection of Douglas Adams' essays, which
he had published in various magazines and news papers throughout his life.
While some carry similar wit and humour as his fictional works, I found that
the essays somewhat underwhelmed me, perhaps because I had hoped to enjoy a
book in similar style to the preceding books,
{{< book_note "Douglas Adams - Dirk Gentley's Holistic Detective Agency">}} and {{< book_note "Douglas Adams - The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul" >}},
which the essays simply weren't.

## The Salmon of Doubt
At the very back of the book is a compilation of different drafts that have been
stitched together to form _The Salmon of Doubt_, and unfortunately it shows.
There isn't the same self-consistency and self-referential style of writing that
the other works of Douglas Adams so beautifully display – it would seem reasonable,
that such features are added during the refining passes that come much later in
the writing process than what we were left with after his tragic and untimely passing.

## Recommendation
I wouldn't pick up this book unless you're a die-hard Douglas Adams fan or have
a particular affinity towards biographical works.
