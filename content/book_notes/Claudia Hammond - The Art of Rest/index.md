## Introduction
Every now and then I fall into the trap of buying a self-help book based on
the fancy promises on the cover, where reputable news papers and reviewers
will utter raving praise and imply that reading the book is a truly life-changing
experience. Spoiler: _It never is_.

Leading the life of a stressed out student, I thought the promise of finding
"respite in the modern age" as given in the book's subtitle was a rather appealing
one.

The book consists of 10 chapters, each detailing one of the top 10 most resultful
activities according to a particular study. I found the writing needlessly verbose
and simultaneously lacking in academic depth.

## Recommendation
Steer clear and spend your time having a restful walk instead.
