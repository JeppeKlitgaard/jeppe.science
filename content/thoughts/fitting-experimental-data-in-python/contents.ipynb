    "\n",
    "As part of my undergraduate studies I recently had to write a formal report on the exciting\n",
    "topic of mechanical resonance after having collected data from the transient and\n",
    "steady state responses of a oscillating torsional pendulum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather problematically, we have yet to be taught any meaningful data processing outside of basic Excel regression,\n",
    "which proved a bit of a hindrance in establishing the quality factor of the oscillator.\n",

    "\"Figure 1: Graph of amplitude and angular frequency\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Supposedly this could be done by taking the ratio of the amplitude at resonance and the amplitude\n",
    "for an angular frequency of 0 radians per second. The amplitude at resonance would then have to be\n",
    "guestimated from the graph in Figure 1.\n",
    "That’s hardly very scientific and in my case introduced such large errors that\n",
    "the estimated quality factor was effectively useless with an uncertainty north of 20%.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A better way\n",
    "A better way of going about this would be to establish the resonant frequency $ω_0$\n",
    "and the damping coefficient $γ$ by fitting the data to the following model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "Performing a custom regression analysis is however not a trivial task given the set of tools made available to a first year Natural Sciences student in the UK.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python to the rescue\n",
    "Luckily Python is an excellent language for all things science and a range of packages give easy access to powerful data analysis tools.\n",
